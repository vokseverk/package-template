# Umbraco Property Editor Template

This is my starter project for an Umbraco Property Editor.

## Process

- After creating a new project from this template, rename the root folder from the
default "package-template" to something that suits your project

- Then find the `src/package.ent` file and change the constants in there

- You may want to change a few things in the `package.xml` file as well

- Edit/add/remove files in the `src/` folder and update the files section in the
`package.xml` file

- Edit this README to describe your new property editor :)


## Building

Running the `build.sh` script builds a ZIP file in the `dist` folder which
should be installable from Umbraco 8's _Settings > Packages_ section or
Umbraco 7's _Developer > Packages_ section.
